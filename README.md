Data collected from citibike, a bike-sharing program in New York City, is being used to glean insights on the business model and explore how a similar program could be executed in Iowa.

- In addition to a worksheet that maps out ride count by locationm, a bar chart on the same dashbaord that shows the Station ID sorted by ride count would be useful. This list could be used to determine inventory levels at each station. 

- Analysis of ride counts by customer and subscriber birth years would provide additional customer insights for targeted marketing campaigns.
